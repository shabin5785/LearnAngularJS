**Pipes**
-----------------
- Pipes are built into angular that allows us to transform output., like converting string to uppercase while displaying

- we have configure a pipe by sending it parameters

- Chained pipes are parsed left to right. So the order of pipes is very important

- we can write custom pipes. Just a calss with a transform method, returning the value converted from input. Also add the class to declarations under app module
