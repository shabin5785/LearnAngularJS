- While creating component using cl1, ng g c <> --spec false, prevents creation of test file.
Also ng g c aaa/<> creates teh component within aaa folder and not the defaut app folder.

- to store data we can use a model. Here model is a vanilla TS class. we can use it like an object in oops langauges.
these classes can be instantiated. 
Fields in TS classes can have access specifiers like public..  public name :string;
