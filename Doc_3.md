**Diretictive  

- There are two types of Directives: Attribute and structural.
Attribute is like normal html ones, which affects the element it is added to, like data or event binding. Structural one affects the DOM so have a * to point this to angular.

- We cannot have more than one structural directive on an element.

- ngClass to change the class dynamically and ngStyle to change style dynamically. Both can be attribute bound using []
